## Dependency
ML-DFA is a custom exchange-correlation functional in <a href="https://pyscf.org/" target="_blank">PySCF</a>, with its ML model built upon <a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank">PyTorch</a>.
A python library <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/nevergrad" target="_blank">Nevergrad</a> is required for the training.

Below is a list of primary python packages with the corresponding versions I used for developing ML-DFA:

python|3.9.12
